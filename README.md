## Project Overview
This project is an *IoT data management solution* for greenhouse sensor monitoring and analytics. It collects data from ESP32-based sensor devices, stores readings in a PostgreSQL database via a Node.js/Express backend, and provides a live dashboard web interface with real-time updates, hourly averages, and historical data visualization.

## Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js v18+ installed
PostgreSQL database server (or MySQL, as configured)
ESP32 firmware and device(s) set up to POST sensor data
Git for cloning the repository

## Clone and Install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chamama-iot-dashboard.git
cd chamama-iot-dashboard
npm install

## Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root. Example (do not commit your actual passwords):
DB_USER=db_user
DB_PASS=db_pass
DB_NAME=db_name
DB_HOST=localhost
JWT_SECRET=jwt_secret

## Database Setup
Initialize PostgreSQL

## Running the Backend/Frontend
npm start
Server runs on http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Connecting ESP32 Devices
Flash provided ESP32 firmware (/iot-device/ directory)
Configure endpoint 

## Viewing The Dashboard
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser for the live dashboard
Swagger documentation is available at http://localhost:3000/api-docs

## Architecture diagram

The Chamama IoT Data Management System follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components to improve modularity and maintainability.

Model: Manages the data and database operations for sensor readings, devices, and users.

View: Provides the user interface through EJS templates and frontend JavaScript, displaying live and historical sensor data.

Controller: Handles user requests and device data submissions via Express API routes, processes business logic, and communicates between Model and View.
